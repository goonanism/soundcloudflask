===============

This bad boy is a pretty simple way of getting what I want out of soundcloud. Basically it hits up the Soundcloud API, creating a few text files which can then be read into some HTML output


Requirements
------------

*[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
*A [Soundcloud](https://developers.soundcloud.com/) account and API Key

Setup
-----

Basically you just need to run it: python sc.py

You also need to update the text files from time to tiem: python update.py

Might be wise to set it up as a cron
